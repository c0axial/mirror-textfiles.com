         with it

        Our society, in the past fifteen years, has undergone a 
massive revolution.  The revolution I am referring to is that of 
the computer becoming a major part of the lives of Americans.  
The computer has permanently changed the way Americans live.  For 
many of us, the use of ATM's is a part of our banking routine.  
Computer microprocessors rear their heads in various household 
appliances such as VCR's and TV's.  Many business people depend 
on personal computers to do their work.  But one undesirable 
aspect of society has undergone a revolution because of computers 
as well: crime.  The computer revolution has given birth to a 
whole new class of criminal: the computer hacker. 
l---+---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----r----R--T-+-- 
        First off, let me give an idea as to what the term "hacker" 
means and how the term has changed its meaning throughout about the 
past fifteen years.  The textbook that I use in my Pascal programming 
class gives this definition for hacking: 
l---+---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6-----r----R--T-+-- 
l---+---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6-----r----R--T-+-- 
     To hack on or at something means to work on it without any 
     great hope of success...Simply hacking something means to 
     explore it for no particular reason, usually late at night.  
     (Cooper & Clancy, 570)
l---+I--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
It was in this spirit of hacking that the hackers of the 1970's made 
having a computer in one's very own home possible at an affordable 
price.  Steve Wozniak, back in 1975, slapped together some chips and 
wires and dubbed his creation "Apple I."  (the Apple II, which actually 
has a keyboard and a case, succeeded the Apple I about a year later.)  
Lee Felsenstein, hacker and inventor of the Osborne I personal 
computer, brought us "the first keyboard- and display-equipped 
microcomputer and designed the first portable computer." (Steinburg 
157).  Even today there are people who like to tinker with electronics 
and computer hardware.  These people who tinker with the insides of 
their computers try to get their computers to perform beyond the limits 
imposed by the manufacturer of their computers.  These people are the 
Henry Ford's and the Thomas Edison's of our day.  These people enjoy 
tinkering with computers as a hobby to occupy their free time and do no 
harm.  But in about the past ten years, the word "hacker" has taken on 
a negative connotation, thanks in part to the news media and the movie 
War Games.  A more appropriate term to describe someone who breaks into 
other computers and causes discomfort and damage via computer is 
"rodent," "cracker," "cyberpunk," or "worm." 
        Because there are people who are involved in the dark side of 
computing, a whole crop of new jargon terms have sprung up in the past 
few years-- allow me to define a few.  Cyberpunks are "computer hackers 
who create harmful programs."  A worm (not to be confused with the 
above mentioning of a "worm") is "a self-contained program that spreads 
through computer networks."  A time bomb is a program that is triggered 
to performed some action when the computer's system clock reaches a 
certain date, like wiping out a PC's hard disk or printing a Christmas 
message on the screen.  A virus is "a rogue computer program that 
copies itself into other programs and diskettes" which is either benign 
or does something nasty such as wiping out the data on a computer's 
hard disk. (Allman 25)  Social engineering occurs when a hacker dupes a 
system operator into divulging passwords and access codes by fibbing to 
the system operator and telling him or her that he (the hacker) needs 
the password or access code for such-and-such a reason. (Hitt & Tough 
48)  A cracker is 1) one "...who breaks illegally into computer systems 
and creates mischief...," and 2) someone who "cracks" the copy-
protection scheme on a piece of commercially-available software so the 
software can be copied for friends/buddies/acquaintances or uploaded to 
a computer bulletin-board system. (Hitt & Tough 48). 
        There have been times when one has gotten his or her long 
distance bill from Sprint, MCI or other non-AT&T long distance carrier 
and has found on the bill a call that he or she never made to 
California that costs some outrageous amount (the farthest west the 
person has made a call in recent years is Missouri and the highest one-
call charge the person has ever run up was about $5.) The reason for 
the call?  He or she has been the victim of a phone phreaker.  Some 
hackers (I will use the term instead of "rodent," "worm," "cracker," or 
"cyberpunk") just can't stand the thought of actually paying for the 
long distance calls they make with their computers.  So they use ill-
gotten access codes to illegally place free long-distance calls, 
stealing long-distance service.  This is known as "phone phreaking."  
Sometimes, phreakers use "black boxes" and other gadgets to aid them in 
their crime.
        By now, one has to be wondering just what these computer 
miscreants are like personally.  I hope I can enlighten on this by 
giving a profile of four Cleveland-area hackers.  I will name two of 
the hackers profiled by the "handle" they use on the computer bulletin-
board systems and computer networks they call, to add color. 
        First of all, let's start with The Fiber Optic G0D (note the 
unusual spelling of "god"!)  The Fiber Optic G0D's original parents 
divorced several years back; his mother then invited another man (whom 
I'm not sure whether or not she married) to live with her.  The FOG  
and I used to fight each other, but then we were somewhat buddies as 
well.  Once I went to the library near where we lived with him and paid 
him a dollar or two to copy a disk of Apple // graphics.  Later I 
realized that he had ripped me off by making me pay him money to simply 
copy a diskette for me.  When FOG came of high school age, he spent the 
ninth grade in alternate school.  Throughout his high school career he 
was suspended and had poor grades.  Finally, last month, he dropped out 
of school in the eleventh grade.  His mother recently kicked him out of 
her house because FOG was caught drinking for the fifth time. 
        Last summer, while I was logged onto the Cleveland Free-Net 
public-access computer system, I "chatted" with Eagle.  While we were 
chatting, he asked me to disconnect from Freenet and have a voice 
conversation with him.  So I did.  He had a three-way line.  On the 
third branch of the line was his friend, who was high on drugs.  The 
three of us talked some, then Eagle put a heavy metal CD in his CD 
player.  Soon after I ended the conversation with them. 
        Also last summer on Freenet I encountered a hacker/phreaker 
named Joe, who also asked me to have a voice conversation.  Joe also 
had a three-way line.  On the other branch of the three-way line was 
his immature, prepubescent, eighth-grade friend.  While the three of us 
were online, he called an operator (probably using some phreaker's 
"black box".)  Joe and his friend tried to determine if I was "elite" 
(which is an adjective that computer miscreants like to described as.) 
        The deeds of these hackers (from what I know about them-- but I 
could be mistaken about them) are innocent when compared to those of 
the notorious Rocky River hacker Mark Koi, who was "busted" for his 
misdeeds back in 1986.  Koi broke into a Congressional system and also 
broke into business and college systems as well (Sawicki 86).  Why did 
Koi get himself into so much trouble?  It all stems from his interest 
in computers.  Mark became interested in computers when he played 
around on a friend's Commodore 64.  Because Mark was now interested in 
computers, he asked for and got a Commodore 64 for Christmas from his 
parents.  He later purchased a modem to go with it.  Mark then began 
hacking on his computer and became addicted to it.  Brian Gesing, a 
friend of Mark Koi, described Koi's hacking as "a full-time job."  Koi 
had "computer-hacker fever...like you're addicted to drugs," according 
to another one of his friends. (Sawicki 158, 162, 163) 
        Mark's misdeeds didn't stop at hacking on his Commodore 64.  He 
and some of his friends would visit Great Northern, Westgate, or an 
Ohio Bell office.  At the two shopping malls, Koi and his cronies would 
haul off credit card carbons to get credit card numbers which Koi used 
to illegally order computer parts.  Koi and his friends would also take 
printouts of passwords and access codes from businesses' garbage 
dumpsters. Also, they would steal "a manual here, a line set there" from 
an Ohio Bell truck.  (Sawicki 161) 
        Now, what was Mark really like personally?  Mark wasn't a 
superachiever or an underachiever, but somewhere in between.  Mark's 
friends are just average kids too, "not particularly known as athletes" 
or "as top scholars."  Mark made decent grades in "math and computers" 
but didn't make such good grades in his humanities classes.  Mark 
joined the school wrestling team, but wasn't very good at wrestling. 
(Sawicki 89) 
        Mark Koi's room "was a true hacker's dream," loaded with books 
about phone systems, computers, and hacking.  Mark's room was almost a 
jungle of wires.  Mark's room wasn't anything like a normal teenager's 
room. (Sawicki 86)
        Hackers such as Mark Koi use what are known as computer 
bulletin board systems (BBS's), run on their personal computers, to 
exchange information on how to break into various computer systems.  
The BBS is somewhat like an electronic representation of a bulletin 
board one would find in a grocery store or other public place-- a place 
to leave messages and to read the messages left by other people, but in 
somewhat the format of a memorandum.  Below is what one will encounter 
when he calls a typical hacker computer bulletin board system.  The 
name of the imaginary system in this discussion will be The Hacker's 
Den.  A user calls The Hacker's Den by instructing the modem connected 
to his computer to dial the phone number of The Hacker's Den.  When a 
connection to The Hacker's Den is finally made, he is greeted by the 
sysop (short for "system operator"-- he's the guy that owns and 
operates the BBS.)  The sysop (short for "system operator") asks the 
user who he (there are almost no female hackers) is.  If the user is 
new, the sysop pelts him with various questions about hacking and 
related illegal acts.  Once the sysop has determined that the user is 
"elite" (skilled in hacking) enough, the sysop grants the user access 
to the BBS.  When the user looks at the files in the file section of 
this BBS, he sees various pirated (illegally copied) computer games.  
Also in the file section are pornographic graphic files.  When he 
visits the message areas on this BBS, one will encounter a "war" base 
where the users who call this BBS do nothing but spill out hatred 
toward each other with messages laden with profanity and sexual 
innuendos.  Also in the message section are message areas where users 
exchange information on how to break into various systems, phreak 
codes, and possibly credit card numbers of innocent victims.  There are 
also message areas that deal with various general subjects such as 
sports and music, along with an area for miscellaneous conversation. 
        All of this leads one to be curious as to what motivates 
hackers to do what they do.  There are several reasons why a hacker 
breaks into computer systems.  One is to bolster his ego.  One hacker 
says this: "Don't forget ego.  People break into computers because it's 
fun and it makes them look powerful."  (Hitt & Tough 47)  Another 
reason is already mentioned by the hacker quoted above: for fun.  
Finally, many hackers enjoy the challenge of defeating computer 
security.  Another hacker feels this way: 
L---+i--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
     But there's nothing wrong with breaking security if you're 
     accomplishing something useful.  It's like picking a lock on a 
     tool cabinet to get a screwdriver to fix your radio.  As long as 
     you put the screwdriver back, what harm does it do? (Hitt & Tough 
     48) 
l---+I--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
One source I consulted had this to say about cyberpunks:
L---+i--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
      Cyberpunks, the second generation of computer hackers, subscribe 
      to an arcane code of honor and look upon cracking supposedly 
      impenetrable networks as a challenging rite of passage. (Marsa & 
      Ray, 96)
l---+I--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
A user of who participated in the electronic discussion on the Well 
BBS, moderated by two editors of Harper's Magazine, described hackers in 
the following manner:
L---+i--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
     Hackers are not sloganeers.  They are doers, take-things-in-
     handers.  They are the opposite of philosophers: they can't wait 
     for the language to catch up to them.  Their arguments are their 
     actions.  (Hitt & Tough 55) 
l---I---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
        The author of one source I consulted divided computer users 
into two camps.  In one camp are people "in business, science, and 
national security" who can't live without their computers to do their 
work.  In the other camp are hackers.  These two groups are at odds 
against each other.  The business, science, and national security users 
hate hackers because they can't afford to have hackers break into their 
computers.  But hackers feel that by finding flaws in systems, they are 
contributing to making systems better. 
        This attitude that hackers have seems noble enough, but 
still, hackers are criminals who cause damage and discomfort.  Phone 
phreaking costs long-distance companies about $500 million annually.  
The long-distance companies probably don't raise their rates to make up 
for this loss, but that $500 million loss is money that isn't re-
invested in more, newer, and better equipment and in new technology 
research for better long-distance service to the honest consumer.  The 
stealing of computer data and software piracy costs companies about $4 
million annually. (Marsa & Ray 100) Some law enforcement people 
describe hackers as "predators on society." (Wallich 34)  A user named 
Mandel, who participated in the discussion on the Well BBS moderated by 
Harper's Magazine, says that "the data on crackers suggests that they 
are either juvenile delinquents or plain criminals." (Hitt & Tough 49) 
     Causing such damage is rather easy.  Lance Hoffman, electrical 
engineering and computer science professor at George Washington 
University, tells just how easy it is: 
L---i---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
     Any kid can go out and, for less than a thousand dollars, buy the 
     electronic equivalent of a Saturday night special.  With the right 
     computer equipment, he can hook up to international networks and 
     do a lot of damage. (Marsa & Ray 100) 
L---i---T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
Just how vulnerable are computer systems?  Anybody who has a computer 
(even a cheap modem), a modem (a gadget that allows one's personal 
computer to connect to other computers via the phone system), some grey 
matter, and persistence can break into almost any system he dials into. 
(Marsa & Ray 98) 
     Since computer hacking is such a new type of crime, society is 
still figuring out how to deal with it and trying to pass laws that 
govern computing. 
L---+i--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
     The Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 made it a crime 
     to own 'any electronic, mechanical, or other device {whose design} 
     renders it primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious 
     interception of wire, oral or electronic communication'."
     (Hitt & Tough 56) 
L---+i--T1----+-T--2----T----3--T-+----4T---+---T5----+-T--6----------R--T-+-- 
A number of prominent people in the computer field have formed the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is a group that sticks up for 
"computer freaks" who are victims of unwarranted searches, seizures, 
and other "incursions" by the government.  The group's mission is to 
"fight for computer users' rights" (Lawren 17)  Robert Morris, who was 
a graduate student at Cornell University, was indicted in 1988 for 
breaking into federal computer systems and letting a computer worm 
loose on a computer network.  The worm did damage to the tune of $96 
million (estimated.)  ("Terminal Case" 11)  The author of one article I 
consulted feels that Morris shouldn't be sent to jail for his computer 
worm that hosed up Internet, since Morris didn't actually destroy and 
data and didn't have criminal intentions when he turned his worm loose 
on Internet. (Hafner 15-16)  About a year ago, law enforcement agencies 
shut down the computer bulletin-board system run by software publisher 
Craig Neidorf because an issue of the electronic newsletter he carried 
on the BBS contained illegal information which Neidorf didn't know was 
illegally gotten by another hacker.  Neidorf's lawyer contended that 
the law-enforcement agency exercised prior restraint on his electronic 
newsletter. 
     In short, computer technology is so new that society still must 
catch up with it and establish "...effective rules of behavior for 
cyberspace..."  The author of the article goes on to say that these 
rules "...will have to wait until the electronic [frontier] has been 
settled..."  (Wallich 38).  In the same article, Kapor says that when 
"the technology becomes more familiar and...secure,...society will be 
better able to make decisions about how (or whether) access to 
[computers] should be controlled." (Wallich 38) 
     The computer revolution has brought with it the wonderful 
innovation of personal computers. Personal computers have enabled many 
a business person to be more productive, have revolutionized the way 
papers are written, music is composed, and the way businesses do their 
accounting.  Computers have changed our way of living.  But along with 
this revolution has come a necessity to use these systems responsibly 
and to set "rules...for cyberspace."
