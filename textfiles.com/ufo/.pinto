 "Remember how the politics of BBS's worked? In order to have a high enough
  access privilege, one had to upload as much as they downloaded.  It was a
  wonderful time to be involved in "telecommunications" technology. I miss it
  sometimes you know.

 "I became especially interested in UFO's after seeing the Hudson Valley UFO
  in September of 1988. I was looking for an explanation of what I had saw. At
  the same time, actually 2 years or so before that, I found out how to log on
  to BBS's through the use of a modem connected to my Apple IIc computer and a
  piece of software called ZTerm or XModem or something like that. Anyway, I
  found a BBS called Paranet Alpha, run by a sysop by the name of Jim Speiser
  in Tucson, AZ that dealt with this topic. I wrote those textfiles and
  uploaded them to him originally. From there, they sort of migrated to BBS's
  everywhere and now they are on the web.

 "I was interested in getting info (textfiles!) about the subject of UFO's.
  So, I began writing about the subject. Sysops from all over loved my papers
  and would immediately jump in and chat with me welcoming me to their system
  when I logged on. (Then they would give me their highest download
  privileges!)
