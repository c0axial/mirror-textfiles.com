IBM-PCs have recently been employed by CRC to enhance the productivity
of remote users.  Complete linkage to the larger computer is provided by   
proprietary software, including local data analysis, generation, and editing   
capabilities on the PC, thus reducing mainframe on-line time.    
     
CRC will lease to its clients the necessary equipment for a remote connection  
or will assist in renting, leasing, or purchasing the necessary equipment  
from outside vendors.  The Center also provides consulting support for
clients who provide their own programmers along with direct programming    
support for those clients who desire it.  The services of the Center are

DTSS is a general-purpose time-sharing operating system which can pro-
vide interactive computing facilities with minimal response time lag for   
up to 300 simultaneous users. Initially designed for system developers,    
DTSS supports multiple file access methods and provides a number of   
development tools, including DaTaSyS, a state-of-the art relational   
database management system; MODEL, a powerful financial planning lan- 
guage; and DI-3000, an integrated system of device-independent graphics    
subroutines. In addition, DTSS offers five different system editors,  
concurrent background batch processing, several statistical and forecas-   
ting systems, and a rich language environment which includes BASIC,   
FORTRAN, COBOL, PLI/1, and others. Its high-powered billing system    
supports multiple rate schedules, royalty surcharging, and session and
project billing.    
     
DTSS Incorporated also offers interactive computing services at whole 
sale rates. The DTSS Associates Plan enables resellers to offer pro-  
prietary software or value-added services at their retail rates via the    
DTSS computing facility. In-house time-sharing services groups can con-    
trol costs and consolidate outside time-sharing usage, with no additio-    
nal hardware or hardware maintenance, by using the Associates Plan to 
bring applications inside. Because the software system offered under the   
AM Plan is identical to the licensed system, a DTSS Associate 
can build up usage on the DTSS interactive computing system, and then 
move in-house with no conversion problems.

ACCESS MARKETING ANALYSIS SYSTEM, a menu-driven, interactive market-  
ing analysis system that integrates internal shipment data with  
syndicated data sources such as SAMI, Nielsen, Majers, and NABSCAN.   
ACorts, complete with presentation quality charts and graphs, 
provide marketing managers with top-line or detailed information on:  
assessing promotions; monitoring pricing strategies; double-checking  
sales forecasts, and managing sales accounts. The ACCESS MARKETING    
ANALYSIS SYSTEM is a fully prompted system designed for easy use.
     
ANALECT DSS GRAPHICS is an intelligent, easy-to-use computer graphics 
sy>7V 3=I general business users. ANALECT DSS GRAPHICS combines 
sophisticated graphic technology with Decision Support System (DSS)   
capabilities. ANALECT gives users the interactive ability to sort,    
select, and analyze massive amounts of data and distill it into  
clear presentation quality charts. ANALECT command procedures can
be saved for future use or for large production jobs. The system 
supports over 125 graphic devices. 
     
ANALECT DSS GRAPHICS utilizes Megatek Corporation's TEMPLATE
graphic technology. The functionality of a complete FORTRAN 
graphics subroutine library is available as interactive ANALECT  
commands. No knowledge of programming is needed.  
     
ANALECT DSS GRAPHICS  may be fully integrated into Dialogue's    
comprehensive ANALECT DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM. This full system  
features other decision support capabilities such as: statistical
and multi-dimensional analysis; report writer; financial model-  
ling; relational data base management system; and application    
building language.  
     
ANALECT DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM is an interactive, comprehensive 
management and systems building tool for financial, sales, pro-  
d},WkK 
 nd marketing applications.  ANALECT's powerful internal
data base management system can handle vast quantities of infor- 
mation and consolidate it into meaningful data bases to meet the 
requirements of any corporate department. The data is organized  
in a Relational Data Base Management System. 
     
ANALECT's range of capabilities include: multi-dimensional data  
analysis; worksheet modelling and "what if" computations; fore-  
casting; multivariate analysis; arima modelling; a report writer;
programming language for custom applications; and presentation   
quality business and custom graphics.   
     
ANALECTS's multiple interfaces support users from programmers to 
eM according to their own levels of computer skills.
Executives are prompted along with on-line menus and HELP aids.  
ANALECT's report writer feature customizes reports to an executive's  
specifications. Sophisticated routines to analyze marketing, financial
or production trends are built into the system for easy use. In  
addition, ANALECT provides links to popular microcomputers and   
spreadsheets.  
     
ANALECT is built in self-contained modules. All  modules contain 
ANALECT's foundation of an interactive command language and basic
data management.  This foundation also includes calculations, DSS
manipulations, display, file management, command sequences, and  
on-line user reference aids.  
     
The ANALECT foundation may be combined with a single module, or a
cluster, to create a smaller, single-function, stand-alone  
specialized system. The most popular of these ANALECT systems are:    
     
ANALECT MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS, which allows a user to structure  
data to reflect the business environment and simplify many analytical 
and reporting requirements. Whole blocks of marketing, financial, or  
other data can be sliced, calculated, and queried with great flexibility.  
     
ANALECT FORECASTING provides a wide array of analysis functions, 
including time-series analysis, regression and econometric model-
ling, seasonal and outlier adjustment and multivariate analysis. 
     
ANALECT REPORTING AND APPLICATIONS BUILDING allows a user to build    
specialized commands, menus, complex analysis and complete inter-
active applications for data bases of virtually unlimited size.  
Users can develop entire applications in a fraction of the time  
that programming languages require. It includes ANALECT/RIM, a   
report writer, a system building language, and the ANALECT foun- 
dation of DSS data management.
     
ANALECT/RIM is a new generation relational data base management  
system for query and reporting. It combines a simple data struc- 
ture with powerful manipulation capabilities. All data bases can 
be queried, screened, merged, sorted and displayed. ANALECT/RIM  
requires no programming skills. It is available as an expansion  
module or as a part of the ANALECT REPORTING AND APPLICATION
System.   
     
ANALECT FINANCIAL MODELLING worksheets are made easier by advanced    
features such as prompted data entry, automatic handling of the  
time dimension and hierarchical consolidation of models and data.
A menu-driven financial facility aids infrequent or novice users 
to ask "what if" questions, to consolidate models, and perform   
sophisticated goal-seeking or sensitivity analysis.    
     
ANALECT software is available on a trial purchase plan or through
time sharing. Prices are available on request.

financial institutions rely on FDSI software to meet their tax and    
financial information needs. Supported by highly trained staff members
in our Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York offices, FDSI meets the
challenge of serving those needs with CORPTAX, CORPTAX CALENDAR, CPATAX    
CALENDAR, MICRO CORPTAX and MICRO ASSET MANAGEMENT.    
     
CORPTAX provides corporate management with an on-line interactive man-
agement information system that has powerful user-friendly  
commands, allowing evaluation of all relevant business alter-    
natives. With one day's training, corporate tax  and financial personnel   
with no prior data processing experience will be using CORPTAX's sophis-   
ticated integrated data base to easily produce tax compliance, modelling   
and planning reports. Automation through CORPTAX reduces the work load
by maintaining current tax and financial logic while permitting easy  
modifications so that this logic will reflect specific corporate inter-    
pretations.    
     
CORPTAX provides the necessary tools for effectively analyzing the    
impact of various strategies by accepting an unlimited number of "what
if" case studies and planning scenarios. CORPTAX also includes a com- 
prehensive tax accounting system. CORPTAX is the management information    
system that brings everything together. 
    k
CORPTAX CALENDAR for the corporate tax professional and CPATAX   
CALENDAR for the CPA are easy-to-use tools providing the means to
supervise tax requirements. Their comprehensive capabilities enable the    
tax professional to concentrate on analytical tasks by automatically  
performing routing functions such as monitoring filing due dates,
estimated payments,  reporting requirements, alternatives for filing or    
extending, and historical fact finding. 
     
The CORPTAX CALENDAR contains a comprehensive data base comprising major   
tax events for Federal and all fifty state returns. CORPTAX CALENDAR  
incorporates a sophisticated Master Calendar, maintained and continu- 
ously updated with applicable legal and regulatory changes by the staff    
of highly qualified tax and data processing professionals at Financial
Decision Systems, Inc.   
     
MICRO CORPTAX is a revolutionary tax planning and compliance system   
designed for stand-alone operation on a micro-computer. Complete with 
the tax logic for all fifty states as well as the Federal return, it  
provides the ability to enter data on forms displayed on line at your 
micro-computer screen in addition to producing the actual returns on  
a dot matrix or laser printer.

OCLC has designed and operates a bibliographic computer and telecommunications 
system that supports resource sharing among libraries. 
     
Through the OCLC Online System, institutions catalog books, serials, and other 
library materials; order custom-printed catalog cards; create machine-readable 
data files; maintain location information on library materials; facilitate 
interlibrary lending; and place and control acquisitions orders.  The system   
provides bibliographic and location information to participating libraries and 
produces bibliographic information in the form of magnetic tapes and printed   
products. 
     
OCLC also offers LS/2000, a local automated library system that permits    
independent processing by libraries and library clusters.   
     
OCLC has many kinds of libraries: academic, academic research, community and/or
junior college, corporate, federal, law, library school, medical, municipal
and state government, public, school, state, and theological.  Directly and
indirectly, OCLC serves over 6,000 institutions.  Several libraries outside the
United States, including libraries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, 
France, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom use the OCLC  
Online System. 
     
As of April 1984, the OCLC database contained approximately 10.6 million   
bibliographic records.   
     
Although OCLC is a not-for-profit corporation, it strives to be a self-    
sustaining organization.  It derives its operating requirements from fees for  
products and services provided to its users.  OCLC does not issue stock, pay   
dividends, or share profits.
